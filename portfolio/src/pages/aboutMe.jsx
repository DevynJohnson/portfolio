        I am a Full Stack Developer with a passion for designing, building, and maintaining applications that deliver seamless user experiences. With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development, I've developed expertise in web design, server creation and deployment, API architecture and routing, user authentication with JSON Web Tokens, and managing both SQL and NoSQL databases. I enjoy building full stack applications using both the MERN and PERN stacks, and take pride in writing clean, efficient code that scales.
          <br />
          <br />
          My approach to development is rooted in problem-solving and continuous
          learning. Whether it be crafting intuitive user interfaces, optimizing
          server performance, or structuring efficient databases, I enjoy
          tackling challenges and refining my expertise to create scalable and
          effective solutions. With a professional background in food service
          management, I am used to working in fast-paced environments and
          collaborating with diverse teams to achieve common goals.
          <br />
          <br />
          Outside of coding, I love spending time on our hobby farm with my wife and our four boys â€” two teenagers and twin toddlers, who ensure there is never a dull moment at home. When I get the chance, I love to lace up my skates to play ice hockey or roll some dice in a game of Dungeons and Dragons with friends. 
          <br />
          <br />
          I am eager to bring my technical skills, problem-solving
          mindset, and passion for development to new and exciting projects.
          <br />
          <br />
          Let's build something great together!
